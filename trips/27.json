After jumping out of a moving car and running full speed through the bushes (i'm talking jungle terrain), my best friend was lost in the florida keys mangroves for almost 24 hours. he was half blind for about 3 days afterwards. best of luck. stick to reef!\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2000ExpID: 27\nGender: Not Specified \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: May 31, 2000Views: 45,871\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n"
