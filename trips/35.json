Extreme salivation, extreme sweating, soggy all around.  Showered.  Prepared oatmeal to nibble to hold off possible nausea.\r\nt2-t6 - waited and waited, in this swamp, but the mental aspects never appeared.  No nausea.  Disappointing.  What to do with many, many more sub-grade A.M. capsules.\r\n\r\nWarning: this caused swelling under tonsils, for two days.  Worse, this caused something like an ear infection which lasted 1 month and continues.  Want to take some metallic orange-gold grade-A caps, but afraid of ear problems.  This material must be the most unreliable in the world.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely recommend that you do not use this material until you have ample cannabis to counteract the salivation and possible nausea, and hopefully counter the sweating. A.M. + cannabis is a good pair, but not A.M. alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2000ExpID: 35\nGender: Male \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: Sep 8, 2000Views: 12,082\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n"
