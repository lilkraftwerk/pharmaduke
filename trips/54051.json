This morning, I had decided to take 1.5 grams of phenibut, a sort of benzo-like 'nootropic' substance that I had decided to test and which had arrived recently. Along with that, I took my usual 800mg of piracetam, and 300mg of L-theanine. The result of this was that all day long, I had been feeling incredibly euphoric, and even though when I laid down, I would sometimes briefly nod off, I paradoxically had loads of energy. I was in the kind of mood where I was bouncing around everywhere I went, brimming with joyous abandon. I had a big smile plastered on my face. This is the only GABA-affecting drug I've ever used that gives me any euphoria, and boy, does it give me euphoria! It's a subtle euphoria that takes about 3 hours to start, and then lasts all day. Subtle because it's not like MDMA or something, where you're obviously under the effect of a drug. It's very natural-feeling, like I'm just in a truly excellent mood and extremely communicative. In other words, I don't feel like I'm on a drug at all, but just feel joyous like one does on a fresh Spring day, the first day of emergence of winter.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we went to this show, which I had been unsure about going to because I knew only my friend E who was playing keyboards in it, his girlfriend M who came with us, and of course my girlfriend L. We got there and before long I knew I had made the right choice. The vibe in that place was great! Everyone was very free-spirited and extremely happy and friendly. There were little kids present, and the sweetest baby I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. There were also friendly dogs. Everyone was just smiling and talking and meeting each other. Then the show started, and it was absolutely amazing. It started out with E playing keyboard, just jamming along with whatever he decided to play, and his friend J (who I'd never met before) was playing along on a bunch of overturned garbage cans and a rusty high-hat, playing the drums. It sounded absolutely great, and I couldn't help but sing along with my own improvization, sometimes pretty loudly I fear. It was unbelievably invigorating.\r\n\r\nThen the aerial dancers began their act. The music turned on, and it was this great meditative chant with really awesome chord changes. I also couldn't help but sing along to this music with my own melodies. The aerial dancers were very beautiful. It was extremely artistic... I've never seen anything like it. It was like a toned-down version of Cirque de Soliel. I was filled with this unspeakable euphoria just by being there and witnessing the beauty. The vibe in this place was breathtaking, a perfectly glorious aura around everyone, fueled by us all. Even the babies and dogs were watching the act with wonder, and were perfectly happy the whole time. So I decided it was the perfect time to...\r\n\r\n8:45 (T+0:00)- ...ingest the 17mg of 2C-B-fly that I had brought for an occasion like this! I went out to my car during a break and got it, and chugged it down (in liquid suspension). Gross! But not nearly as bad as most substances I have ingested. I waited around, watching the show, and first noticed the wonderful effects of 2C-B-fly creeping up at around 9:15. They were subtle at this point. The show ended at about 9:30, much to my disappointment. But then it was time to go around and meet people. Which we did. Everyone was incredibly nice and cool. The vibe in the air for this event was absolutely great. It was a vibe full of love and happiness and acceptance. Even the baby and animals were affected.\r\n\r\nAt about 10:00, E and M and L and I decided to head back to E's place to smoke some cannabis. E decided to bring his friend J, as well. Now, these people, especially J, are very difficult to keep on task, and 10:30 soon rolled around without any sign of E or J, anywhere. Soon I became tired of waiting to smoke, since from my last experience I determined that I don't really fully feel 2C-B-fly until I smoke. So I went to my car and smoked a quick bowl with L, and came back out to mingle and wait for E and J. Sure enough, about 10 minutes after smoking, I was overcome with a wave of beautiful euphoria (even more than before!) and energy. I began to follow my girlfriend L and M around, and we kept stopping to talk with people we had just met. At this point, I think everyone who didn't know me probably thought I was on MDMA, because I was smiling hugely and walking and jumping around everywhere. I mean, it felt so good to be moving that I just couldn't keep still! But I sure didn't care, and neither did they. I got a few smiles, as I really got the idea that very few others present were under the effects of any substances, except perhaps a few people who had smoked some herbs. But the vibe was very tolerant and non-threatening, so it didn't bother me. I found my way to the fruit bowls, and began eating massive amounts of fresh grapes and strawberries, which was absolutely orgasmic. 2C-B-fly is a great taste enhancer, I've found, and the more I ate, the more I became hungry. Fortunately there was plenty of fruit left. No one was eating it anymore, so I ate all the rest of it. It truly was the best and healthiest dinner I've had in quite some time. \r\n\r\nI continued to walk and jump around, enveloped in happiness and warmth, until it was finally time to go after E reappeared. As we're getting into our cars (with L driving mine, just in case), E tells me he feels like doing some coke tonight. He said there might be some at his place when we get there. My girlfriend has never done it and has traditionally been very wary of almost all drugs, especially those she considers 'hard'. But she was very curious and kept asking about it, and whether or not she should try. E told her he thought every human being was better off never trying coke, but that if she did, she shouldn't feel bad about it as long as she can control it. I told her that she should try it, because I pay for all of our drugs, and she has money only for school, and plus she doesn't know where to get anything. And I've never had any problems controlling my use of that one. I told E that I'd be interested in that if it was there, for sure.\r\n\r\nYou see, I had just a few weeks ago told my girlfriend that I had in fact used coke before, which I had hidden from her at the time because she was extremely intolerant about that kind of stuff and would have been really mad and disgusted by it. But now she's much more loosened up, and she just thought it was interesting that I had tried it, and that I could have lied so successfully to her all those years. So basically, she was just starting to express interest in trying some other things, and was finally not upset with me for wanting to sometimes use these chemicals. Anyway, we followed E to his house in a 10-minute drive across town. During the drive, L and I had a really important and successful talk about our situation, which is that I have a well-paying job and she just goes to school. This at times is frustrating for me, because I'd like to be able to save money but I'm really not able to do so very well because I have to end up paying for both of us, including rent. But we fully intend to be together forever, so it's really kind of the best thing. She's a piano performance graduate student, and she's really damn good. She's able to practice eight hours a day, and she's improving by leaps and bounds.The school she goes to has given her unbelievable connections in the professional classical piano world. The point is that she would be unable to put as much work into it as she does with a full-time or even heavy part-time job, and I've realized it's a worthwhile trade to help her become successful for the time being. And anyway, she's really conscious of what I provide for her and very appreciative. Plus, I have to admit I enjoy providing for the people I love.\r\n\r\n10:45 (T+2:00) - We arrive at E's house, and immediately E goes into the kitchen and breaks out a little baggie of very good-looking coke, and cuts out 3 lines. The tricky bastard! He meant that he already had it, and that's why it 'might be at his house'. Anyway, we asked my girlfriend L if she wanted some, but she declined due to being drunk, high, and heavily kratommed already. Plus I think E's words of warning turned her off a bit, unfortunately. Then E and M took their lines, and then E handed the snorting tube to me. Yay! L was present at the time, and she watched me with curiosity as I snorted up a small line, the same size as the others had had. I had a certain giddiness present that I was doing a line of coke while my girlfriend was watching, because it's been my dream for the past 4 and a half years that I'd not have to hide my drug use (aside from the ones we do together) from her, and this was a really good start.\r\n\r\nWithin minutes, my euphoria became much more focused, and even greater in magnitude. At this point I went into the main sitting room where everyone was, including E's next door neighbors S and N, a couple. We were all sitting around in a circle, talking. J began telling us all about his 3 salvia experiences with breaking through. It was awesome! I felt like I was on Bluelight or something, discussing drug experiences. Several full-blown psychonauts were present. I had a sudden suspicion that J was a member there, and asked him about it, but it turns out that he in fact was not even familiar with any discussion groups. Damn. Oh well. One day I'll end up accidentally meeting a fellow Bluelighter. In any case, the flow of the night began to turn toward discussing drug experiences, predominantly psychedelic ones, and I think it really helped to further open my girlfriend L up to the possibility to trying them in the future, having heard of so many others' experiences.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I continued on, talking non-stop to everyone with a very clear head and incredible euphoria, for a long time. After seemingly hours had gone by, I found out that it wasn't even midnight yet (T+3:15). It seems that the 2C-B-Fly, which slows down time somewhat, eliminated the speeding up time effect that coke usually has for me. Obviously, since I was having an excellent time, this was very welcome indeed! I started getting my vaporizer going around, and E rolled up a joint which we smoked. Then J started talking about kratom, and S and N said they had been curious about it since E had told them about it (I've sort of got E loving kratom, and he makes sure to always have it handy now). J, M and E also decided they wanted some, so I went ahead and prepared doses for everyone, except my girlfriend who decided she didn't want any more at that point.\r\n\r\nAfter some more chilling and talking and euphoria, the kratom was ready and cooled enough to drink. So drink it we did! I always enjoy introducing people to kratom for the first time because I find that the effects and euphoria from it is sort of a shared group experience, so that it feels quite a bit like my first time when others are doing it whose first time it is. So we all drank up. Shortly after, M, who had had substantial amounts of wine, actually passed out uncontrollably, not to be roused for the duration of the night. This was surprising since she had had a line of cocaine, but there it was. The rest of us slowly began being overcome with kratom euphoria and body buzz. For me, it was spectacular. The kratom just added to the overall euphoria and added tremendously to the overall body buzz. I was in absolute heaven. We passed around the vaporizer for another hit each, which only increased the overall experience, as it tends to do.\r\n\r\n12:30 (T+3:45) - At this point, the most memorable event of the night took place. Everyone I had started talking to, I ended up getting into epic conversations with, which is somewhat unlike me when sober, as I tend to like to be a quiet guy, just listening to what is happening. But in the euphoria I was enveloped in, I just couldn't stop talking. Well, I got into a conversation with S that was slowly turning towards psychedelics. I found out that he's a fellow psychedelic explorer, with many LSD and mushroom experiences behind him which have done great things in opening up his mind and making him more conscious, and in experiencing himself as part of the collective lifeforce of existence. Basically, this conversation was right up my alley. I suddenly started spilling my guts about my activities with tripping lately, specifically Shulgin's creations and my experiences resulting therein. He was incredibly interested, and we had a great conversation that lasted until about 1:30 in the morning, going back and forth about psychedelic experiences, but mainly mine, since he wanted to know all about the RCs and such. I told him all about experience reports, and how I'm an published author, and about how he could research any drug on the internet and also read all of my experiences in detail. I told him about the online discussion communities and how I've never gotten to tell anyone in person about all of this because I'd not found anyone who was open minded enough about psychedelics to safely tell them (until now). He was extremely curious about the RCs and ketamine, and asked me all about them. I told him everything I knew (an overview at least), and told him about how to find out more. He said he'd probably be interested in these, and I told him if he researches it and discovered that he'd like to try them, I can tell him how to get them, or perhaps let him share my own stash with me.\r\n\r\nAt about 2am, it was finally time to go, as E had to play a gig at a church in the morning and was going to bed. I didn't really want to leave at all, as my experience had not abated at all yet, but I unfortunately had to. On the way back my girlfriend and I chilled some more and talked, and she mentioned how I totally still seemed myself. I told her I was, and that I was just feeling really damn good. Once we got home, we ate some ice cream and watched a little TV. I intended on taking a couple of milliliters of 1,4-butanediol to see what it would do to the high, but surprisingly I was able to fall asleep easily, in fact, I did so by accident while watching TV.\r\n\r\nI woke up in the morning feeling 110%, ready to take on the new day. I got plenty of restful sleep and had absolutely no hangover of any kind upon waking.\r\n\r\nOVERALL ANALYSIS:\r\n\r\nThis combination was absolutely excellent. The euphoria I experienced was much more 'real' than MDMA or methylone, and much longer lasting. The 2C-B-fly seemed to totally eliminate the comedown from the coke (although having only one small line probably helped a lot in that department as well), and in the process made the coke euphoria much cleaner, and it also made it linger on for the entire night. It wasn't even gone when I went to bed, hours later. Also, the 2C-B-fly made the jitteryness non-existant, and I was even able to fall asleep with no problems whatsoever. In fact, I was going to stay up and write this report and take 2mLs of 1,4-butanediol to help fall asleep, but I laid down and next thing I knew, it was morning.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the coke synergized extremely well with the 2C-B-fly, creating a supreme euphoria which combined aspects of both drugs. The chattiness of coke with the base, very clean-feeling euphoria of 2C-B-fly. It was literally perfect. I prefer this combination to MDMA any day, because it also left my mind extreme lucid, and there was no comedown to speak of.\r\n\r\nAlso, the kratom just added to everything and probably helped eliminate the bad side effects that may have emerged. I find that adding kratom as the last substance to any combination reduces the negative side effects, eliminates the jitteryness/anxiety, and increases the positive effects, while also eliminating or nearly eliminating the hangover the next day.\r\n\r\nOverall, I made some new friends who I think will become close, had some irreplacable and very excellent conversation, and discovered one of the best combinations I've ever had the pleasure of imbibing. Overall, it was an excellent night! I look forward to the next experiment, whenever that may be. I wonder about sharing some of my 2C-B-fly with E next time, but I don't have much, so I'm not sure if I will. A shame. I sure wish that one was still around.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, though, I've finally gotten to a point where I no longer feel that I have to hide my drug use, at least while in groups at party times, from my girlfriend. It was such a rush being able to do coke and discuss my psychedelic experiences right in front of her, and she didn't get the slightest bit weird about it! I cannot describe how awesome this is to me, because the ONLY problem we have at this point is that I feel bad that I have to hide those things from her, and that I can't share them with her. The fact that she's moving closer to the day when she can do some of them with me makes me practically giddy with joy!\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2006ExpID: 54051\nGender: Male \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: Jul 3, 2006Views: 41,043\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n",
