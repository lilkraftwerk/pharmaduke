I have lost my deep dive certification. Ive been demoted to drugie newbie status along with cold medicine aficionados and people who wander around the playa asking strangers if they have any liquid x for sale. I was once hard core, I am no longer.\r\n\r\nThe evening started out well enough with a heavy dinner of rice and seafood washed down with a healthy dose of margaritas (hornitos, orally administered). Later, on there was a request from others in our group for a little bit of k before the walk to a party at a friends house and not wanting to be left out, I took a bit. It was fun briefly followed by a bit of stumbling and then the wishing it would go away, which it did.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting until I didnt feel any effects from the evening's previous indiscretions, I downed a bit of B in fruit juice over about 30 minutes (I drink slowly) and everything was _peachy_ where peachy includes some kissing, some talking, etc. Then my girlfriend (who was taking the same things at similar times and doses) passed out for exactly 2 hours. She was completely unwakable and unresponsive to anything.  After we verified a strong pulse and healthy breathing, and laid her out on a bed in a dignified and attractive manner, we proceeded to continue to have our little get-together in the bedroom while periodically admiring her beauty and noting her continued healthy pulse and breath.\r\n\r\nAny intelligent person would have stopped there. Called it a night and switched to some nice mint tea (decaf, orally administered). Not me, I was having a grand time and once my girlfriend woke up again I didnt want to stop my g-like drunkenness so I poured myself another glass of floor cleaner. This is when the trouble started. There was some spinning at first, then the incoherent (and horny) babbling, then the nausea set in and I went to the bathroom to deal with any resulting unpleasantness.\r\n\r\nI woke up exactly two hours later, naked, with my girlfriend sitting next to me, and a strong desire to puke. This I did, for the following two hours or so. Every time I felt like I was done and attempted to stand, that turned out to be a horrible idea. Finally after a shower, sending my slightly puke-stained clothing through the wash, I was able to rejoin the party (still in progress) with a deep sense of shame at my foolishness. In my defense, I left alone the nitrous (this was causing the party to continue in spite of the prevailing morning conditions outside). I did learn a valuable lesson and will confine my activity to safe combinations like cocktails of AMT, datura, and paint thinner from now on (note: I'm joking, don't be like me kids, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2006ExpID: 53780\nGender: Male \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: May 24, 2007Views: 25,565\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n",
