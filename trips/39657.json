I should note that my class is both crowded and heatednot to Bikram levels, but still hot.  I have experimented between once and twice a month for about six months for a total of ten experiments.\r\n\r\nI would describe my pre-shroom yoga ability at somewhere between beginner and intermediate, but during a good yoga/shroom class I find that even expert-level poses are within my reach.  The shrooms work to improve my practice in the following ways:\r\n\r\nI feel more centered, so my balance improves.\r\n My muscles relax, so my flexibility increases.  I have very tight hips and normally I struggle with poses like pigeon. But on an optimal shroom dose I am able to get deep into the stretch.  \r\n My breathing slows and deepens.  Without any conscious effort, I am able to do the deep yogic breathing instructors always encourageeven during the most strenuous parts of class.\r\n Lastly, I am able to reach deeper levels of meditation during the restorative portion of the class. Sometimes I have closed-eyed visuals of trippy, Alex Grey-like images of energy flowing through my body.  Sometimes I have no visuals at all, but I always feel that the healing aspect of my yoga practice has increased exponentially.\r\nI dont know whether these benefits are due to the fact that Im able to practice yoga at a much higher level (no pun intended) or whether the benefits result from a direct effect of the shrooms on my psyche.  Most likely they are a delicious combination of both factors.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I find interesting is that most of the benefits are quantifiable.  A question skeptics often ask entheogen users is, How does tripping benefit your regular life?  This is always difficult to answer, because the benefits of entheogens are as complex and subjective as the human mind itself.  I may think tripping gives immediate and lasting benefits to my music/writing/art/love life, etc., but how do I prove that?  Now I have finally stumbled upon an easily quantifiable benefit: I know objectively that my yoga practice improves while I am under the influence of shrooms.  Should I ever be able to volunteer for a study of this phenomenon, a scientist would be able to measure improvements in my flexibility, as well as my more relaxed breathing, heart rate, etc.  Even without a doctor measuring physiology, anyone with a regular practice knows when they are able to stretch farther into a pose.  \r\n\r\nNow a word about dosageI started my experiments with about 1.5 grams of dried shrooms (Psilocybe cubensis) and slowly worked my way up to my ideal: 2.2 grams.  I consume the shrooms in a tea approximately 45 minutes before class begins (to avoid digestive discomfort).  I take an amount that is just shy of what would give me light open-eyed visuals of the Persian carpet variety.  Once the open-eyed visuals start, I find the coordination and balance aspects of my practice too difficult.  Conversely, I find there is very little wiggle room between an optimal dosage and too low of a dose that barely benefits my practice at all.  I have been patient in experimenting, and the benefits from an optimal dosage have astounded me.  A good yoga/shroom day can make a struggling beginner yogi like me feel like I have just received a class from the Buddha himself.\r\n\r\nI fervently hope a researcher will one day conduct a study into this type of benefit.  In the meantime, more anecdotal trip reports may help establish a foundation for future research.\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2004ExpID: 39657\nGender: Male \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: Nov 16, 2005Views: 30,663\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n"
