My best friend had done coke before - is still fighting the addiction - and so I knew that if I was going to do this I would at least have someone experienced around me. \r\n\r\nI was so nervous before I did that first line. My stomach was all in knots. In retrospect, I did a monster line. Almost immediately my pulse sped up and I felt a little edgy. After a few minutes I calmed down and did another monster line. I began to feel almost as though I was on X, only I had much more energy and couldn't stop moving around. My friend chooses to use coke with needles, and though at first i refused to even watch him, I was so out of my head after maybe an hour that when he offered to give me a hit intravenously, I didn't have any problem with it even though I hate needles. I'm not sure where my self-defense mechanisms went, but all I cared about was how to get a better rush. I wanted to know what my friend was feeling. I was talking a mile a minute, feeling very open. In that respect it was similar to ecstasy, but without the physical sensetivity. The intravenous rush was more like smoking rock than snorting the powder. Almost immediately I felt something pushing me back, making me relax, making me feel good. I had to close my eyes. I did that twice (though I'd said only once and never again), and I hope I never do it again. I don't like the idea of having no real self control. I did so much coke that night that I physically could not stop moving around. We started using at around 11:30 PM and the next time I looked at the clock it was 4:30 in the morning. I couldn't believe that so much time had passed. \r\n\r\nBy 6:00 the entire eightball was gone. I don't know who had the majority of it, but my friend was coming down hard while I was still wriggling around in my underwear and a tank top (at some point during the night I had decided that the pants needed to come off).\r\n\r\nI left his house with a bad feeling. Using cocaine can be a social thing, but not if an addict is involved. It wasn't as though we were hanging out together and doing this. He was using and I was using and we were in our own separate worlds. I don't feel good about that. I feel drugs should be used to enhance, not to separate. \r\n\r\nSo from that first experience I learned that 'everything in moderation' should be applied to cocaine as well. ODing on coke, a line that I believe I was teetering on, is no fun. Coke can be fun, but not if you use it for the wrong reasons (eg: because you need more, because you're depressed, etc). Be smart, listen to your body, and be careful. \n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2000ExpID: 17\nGender: Female \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: May 31, 2000Views: 57,597\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n"
