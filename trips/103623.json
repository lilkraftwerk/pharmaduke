I figured that the next best thing might be a modified candy flip using AL-LAD and 5-MAPB.\r\n\r\nI had recently experienced both AL-LAD and 5-MAPB separately and found both to provide excellent experiences. I have had various doses of AL-LAD, starting with 100 micrograms and working up to 300 micrograms. At the higher dose it felt similar to the LSD that I had done many times decades ago, but much more forgiving and of shorter duration (about 4-5 hours). My experience with 5-MAPB was similar. I started with an allergy test of 30 mg and felt no effects. At 100 mg it reminded me very much of MDMA, and 130 mg turned out to be the sweet spot. I actually enjoyed it much more than MDMA. \r\n\r\nMy past experiences include the classic psychedelics, stimulants and some of the more common research chemicals, including 4-ACo-DMT, 4-HO-MET, 2C-I and both 25C-NBOMe and 25B-NBOMe, among others. \r\n\r\nSet: Relaxed state of mind having just come back from surfing with a friend of many years. I have known R for decades and consider him my all-time best friend. No pressing problems as this was a Sunday at the end of a relaxing week-long vacation.\r\n\r\nSetting: My friend's apartment near the beach. Bright and sunny outside, but cool and comfortable indoors. \r\n\r\nAt T=0 we both take 250 micrograms of AL-LAD and three capsules of 5-MAPB carefully weighed at 40 mg each for a total dose of 120 mg on completely empty stomachs. We put on some music and chat.\r\n\r\nT=00:12. We both comment that we are feeling the first effects, namely a chemical feeling in our throats and possibly the first bit of the 5-MAPB. \r\n\r\nT=00:20. The 5-MAPB is definitely there. I'm relaxed and feel an easy warmth in my body. Of course, no signs of the AL-LAD yet.\r\n\r\nT=00:40. Now we are both fully up on the 5-MAPB. The body load is extremely pleasant, conversation comes easily and the music is sounding incredibly good.\r\n\r\nT=00:50. The first bit of the AL-LAD is coming into play. Everything has a sparkle and shimmer that is  very pleasant to behold. Over the next half hour we come up more fully on the lysergide component. Open eye visuals are fairly mild with a classic LSD appearance, and closed eye visuals are fascinating and non-threatening.\r\n\r\nT=01:30. We are both fully immersed. I find it hard to stay in the upright position and end up splayed out on the sofa. R is lying back in the recliner with his eyes closed and saying how good everything is. We discuss our long friendship and how grateful we are that we were born at the time we were, in the U.S, in Hawaii and that we grew up near the beach. We agree that we grew up at a special time in history. We're old guys by most people's accounts but are accepting of it and actually happy that a lot of the heavy lifting necessary to get and maintain a career and to raise a family are done. We are at a point in our lives where we don't care as much for what others opinions of us are. We also get to have some sort of experience like this every couple months and don't live or die for drugs and alcohol. We feel that in moderation we have the best of both worlds. As R describes it, we get a chance now and then to wring our brains out and rid ourselves of the daily crap that bombards us in modern culture.\r\n\r\nT=02:00 to 03:30. We continue the peak experience and end up putting on some surf videos. The music and the visual experience are just breathtaking. We both have perma-grins plastered on our faces, and there is exultation watching someone make a big wave, getting way back in the hollow tube and being spit out just before the wave collapses. I should say that at this point, although we are at the height of the experience, that I would be able to deal with someone from the outside world for a short while. I have eye wiggles and also blurred vision from my widely dilated pupils. There is no way I could drive safely at this point.\r\n\r\nT=03:30. We both take two more 40 mg capsules of 5-MAPB as we feel this component is beginning to fade. In another 20 minutes we are both back up.\r\n\r\nT=04:00-05:00. Ever so slowly I feel the AL-LAD effect beginning to fade. At this point in an LSD trip I'm actually glad to be coming down, but in this case I'm sad to see it go. As the time wears on, both drugs begin to fade. The comedown is fairly easy, but I have a distinct headache and tired feeling.\r\n\r\nT=05:00+. We are now at the point where we are talking about the experience in the past tense and recalling some of the more interesting parts of the trip. Besides the headache there is just a pleasant glow, and we both agree that this was a winning combination. The AL-LAD part was easy enough, but the 5-MAPB made it so that a bad experience seemed almost impossible. Given my dwindling stock of AL-LAD and its current scarcity, we agree that we will hold off doing this again until there is a special occasion or circumstance that calls for such an amazing experience.\r\n\r\nFor others considering the same experiment, as always, go low, go slow and don't drive while under the influence.\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2014ExpID: 103623\nGender: Male \nAge at time of experience: 50 \nPublished: Aug 1, 2014Views: 6,822\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n",
