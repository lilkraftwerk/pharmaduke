We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.] \n\nMy first experience with freon was excellent.  I tried it after an awesome night at a rave.  You get the same 'wa-wa' effect as a single n2o ballon except with just a more little potency.  I soon found myself emptying whole airconditioning systems in a single evening.  The most difficult problem I had was getting the dose right, too much and you just black out (stitches in the head suck, had my share), not enough and you get the 'wa-wa's'.  Somewhere in the middle was an excellent hallucent plain. I found the best was with my eyes closed.  I could see the surroundings around me..walls, cars, cardboard-boxes, ect., but with an amazing  brilliant color coating (much better than any acid trip I've had) like the background from a Grateful Dead poster.  \n\nI had many 'friends' visit during my 30-60 second highs.  Voices and faces would come in and go.  The other bad part was the occasional (every 2-3 days or evenings) vomiting.  This is caused from the oil and other impurities not found in n2o)  I was usually too high to care, I have a weak stomach anyhow (more than 3-4 beers an hour makes me sick).  \n\nI did find myself addicted for a couple of months, although it was mostly a mental addiction not physical.  I was a junky, if you can become one off of freon.  I was spending 75% of my free time huffing on any A/C that wasn't in plain sight of a street.  Mostly at schools or churches that i knew no one would be at in the middle of the night or Saturday afternoon.  I eventually did get caught by the police (simple tresspassing and destruction of property, no charges pressed, the cops didn't really know what to do with me), I was making too much noise behind a business that backs up to a neighborhood.  \n\nThe reasons I choose freon was of it's accessibility (every car, home, refrigerator, trailer has some, you just have to have a pair of pliars and a drinking straw or ink pen), it's duration (all motor skills return in 5-15 minutes, vs. alcohol 2-6 hours), and it doesn't come out in blood or urine tests.  \n\nSome suggestions: don't do it at a location that you frequent (your house or car), freon is expencive to replace. Second do it with a friend in case you black out so they can keep an eye on you. Third sit down, I had stitches in the back and top of my head twice.  I have since turned 21 and can get alcohol for myself or find acid, although i still enjoy the occational 'binger'.\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2000ExpID: 44\nGender: Not Specified \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: Sep 10, 2000Views: 25,320\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n"
