This second encounter blew it out of the water. The setting was a party by a lake in the countryside surrounded by sheep and cows. Initially I had intended to wait and eat this stuff with a friend of mine in a less social setting; but since everyone around me was on mushrooms and I didn't think that the 2C-D was anything I couldn't handle, I ate myself about 40mg in a gel cap and prepared for the best.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure of a timescale here, more because I don't carry a watch and was smoking pot the whole time, but these numbers should be reliable enough:\r\n\r\nT+30mins: First alerts... I think... Four beers and a few joints are interfering with the come-on. I'm not sure whether I'm going to experience this fully as a result.\r\n\r\nT+1:00: Sitting around a campfire attempting to play bongos. I'm a poor drummer usually, and this drug has not in any way enhanced my ability to play. Nor does the music sound any better than usual. However, if I allow myself to look at the trees around us for a moment or two, the image seems to split into seperate Red, Green and Blue channels, as if I was wearing 3-D glasses. I give up drumming to follow this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nT+2:00: Feeling very good. Nothing euphoric but that doesn't even seem desirable right now. If anything, I'm quite present, perhaps even more present than I would usually be at 3 in the morning. Visuals are astounding by now, and if I give myself a moment to regard any scene it will explode into a sequence of electrified aztec spirals of Red Green and Blue. Despite all this I am still completely functional, and only feel overwhelmed by the beauty of my surroundings, not by the drug. I do not need to sit or lie down, I am quite energetic, but more awake than stimulated.\r\n\r\nT+3:00: This was probably my peak, since my memory of this region is a little sketchy. I know I played a little guitar at some point, but again I don't think the music was really enhanced much. This one's not a dance drug. Around here is where the laser-sharp precision of thought I experienced at a lower dose disappears, since my mind is tripping wildly. Visuals are rampant, and the sun is coming up. Going for a piss provides me with my first view of the bright morning sky, and I can see great patterns and calander wheels in the blue.\r\n\r\nT+3:30: Verbal responses begin to break down. I blame this partially on one guy who took 2 doses of shrooms and a hit of MDMA. He is fine, physically, but is yearning for human contact and keeps ranting words like 'Fanoodle' at me. This is my first encounter with the guy, and I don't have anything against him. So I just sit with a joint and try stoner ranting. The guy is incapable of speaking with any depth, and seems aggresive in a nonsensical kind of way. At first I thought he just wanted to chat, but soon I get the impression that he's talking to me to get some of my salvia. I don't say no, but don't say yes either since he seems too fucked up to be smoking such a thing right now.\r\n\r\nT+4:30: My sentences are filled with extra syllables, and I find this to be hilarious. I still haven't asked my friends what I sounded like at this point, but I remember sentences like 'I put a bit of the thing on the side of the thing cos it was only a little bit of telemorphic extramicationitudes' as being the norm. I am still happy but a little tired following a whole night without sleeping. Visuals are still there, a brief look at a hill across the lake becomes a neon and static postcard from an ecotopian future. Despite my inability to communicate normally, I am thinking clearly and continue to collect firewood, roll joints etc.\r\n\r\nT+7:00: I tried to sleep for an hour or two and spent the remainder of my trip playing bongos and such in a tent with some freinds. The guy on his first pill is quite annoying and won't stop bothering people, I feel sorry for him but still can't really speak english. Visuals are pretty nominal, but I'm definitely still tripping.\r\n\r\nT+9-12:00: Since the bus will be here soon, we pack up our tents and say our goodbyes. I feel a bit isolated on the way back but I'm sure everyone does, and so we sleep throughout the trip. I have to get a train back from the bus and go to my station only to end up talking to a friendly stranger who gives me a beer. I give him some pot as a thank you. We end up waiting for two hours for the train, and even after the ride home I have to walk for another half hour. Despite my exhaustion I find this quite enjoyable. The 2C-D is still there, the trees on the way home have eyes on them. I get home and go right to bed.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nWow. I would like to spend a day with this stuff, just wandering around a park with a friend. I never realised it would be so visual... Or that it would do that to my speech. However that speech thing tends to happen when I smoke too much pot, and I'm not sure how much I ended up smoking so I'm not going to lay the blame on the 2C-D just yet. The fact that this stuff had me still tripping slightly almost 12 hours later goes to show that this is no mild psychedelic. In fact this is easily the strongest trip I've had in a year. I don't trip often, but when I do I usually feel quite burned out after the whole experience. This time, all I had was a little tiredness and space-cadet syndrome. No burn-out, no stomach upsets, no jaw aches, nothing. In fact this may be my favourite trip so far, since at no point did I lose touch with reality and find myself in unfamiliar territory. The world itself was the world in which I tripped.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, I do not think I will be doing 2C-D often. It is a unique drug with quite a nice, friendly and electrical character; but doesn't push you as far as mushrooms or tryptamines would, and many might be disappointed by its inability to overwhelm. Its effect upon the emotions is pleasant but cetainly not euphoric, and so the drugs-for-pleasure crowd may be bored by its apparent mildness. Psychonauts would be well at home in 2C-D's kingdom, and some may even learn to love it, but there is nothing particularly 'new' here, and anything learned must be learned by the person themselves, not 'taught' by the drug.\r\n\r\nWhat did I gain from the experience? I feel more at home with the plants and trees than I once did, and am not afraid of bugs, spiders, sheep or cows. The natural setting probably did this just as much as the drug, and so I will not be touting my 'newfound love for nature by way of 2C-D' anytime soon. Mostly I rediscovered how amazing tripping can be in the company of freinds. I am unchanged, but do not find this to be a bad thing. \r\n\r\nAnyone looking to try 2C-D should be warned that this is no museum drug at higher doses, and that you'll get more out of it the more you put in. I wish all who try this stuff in the future luck, and hope that anyone who read through this entire report found it to be at least slightly interesting.\r\n\r\n-D\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2004ExpID: 34559\nGender: Male \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: Jun 22, 2004Views: 26,125\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n"
