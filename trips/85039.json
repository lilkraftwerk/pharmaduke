Given that it is frequently compared to MDMA and the sorry state of the available ecstasy tablets in our area (plus mephedrone's legal status) we decided to give it a shot.  Just a side note, we ordered it only days before the UK ban on mephedrone went into effect, and it was kind of amusing how the guy packaged it.  On the outside of the package the guy wrote 'DVD gift' as the contents, but even better yet, the little bag of mephedrone was actually stored inside a blank DVD case.  It made it through customs and to our doorstep without any problems at all. \r\n\r\nMany of the available reports on mephedrone mention its tendency to cause compulsive redosing, so before we even started we decided that for our first time, we would start with an initial dosage of 150mg orally, and then follow with a boost of no more than 100mg later if we felt like we needed it.  Many reports involve much higher doses than that, but in the name of harm reduction and because it was our first time, we decided to proceed with caution.  At the time, I wasn't really considering writing an experience report, so I didn't pay incredibly close attention to the times, but I think I have a generally good idea of when we did what. \r\n\r\nI had to work the next morning, so we wanted to start early and keep it short.  One of the attractive things about this substance is that it is reported to have a short duration with few after-effects (so long as one does not redose too much).  We measured out 150mg each which we dissolved in ginger ale and consumed it at about 6pm.  It dissolved quickly and cleanly with no lumps.  Jillian and I both have experience with MDMA, however Laura does not.  At this point, it also came to our attention that Laura takes Prozac.  I am not sure if SSRIs will have the same effect on mephedrone that it does on MDMA, but I suppose we will find out.\r\n\r\nWithin about ten or fifteen minutes, I began to experience some signs of onset.  I had slight chills, an increase in energy, and I felt my mood beginning to elevate.  I had not eaten in about 8 hours, Jillian and Laura had not eaten in even longer.  They both reported feeling a slight change in consciousness, but nothing significant at this point.\r\n\r\nWithin about 45 minutes after ingestion, I was feeling rather strong effects.  Much like with MDMA, my sense of touch was greatly enhanced.  I enjoyed running my fingers through my hair and walking around felt nice.  Music was enhanced as well, but none of us had any desire to dance.  There was a period of about ten minutes when I may have not been able to distinguish this from MDMA, but that feeling quickly faded and gave way to a lesser but still enjoyable level of euphoria and stimulation.\r\n\r\nAt about the 1.5 hour mark, we decided that it was time to go ahead and boost, since we were all feeling as though we were approaching baseline.  We each took another 100mg orally.  At this point we were all ready to take a little more, but only Laura said that she felt a really strong moreish urge to take more.  Jillian and I both expressed that we were going to take more because that is what the original plan was, but that we would also have been able to resist if it were for some reason necessary.\r\n\r\nWe all felt a slight boost in the effects from the second dose, but nothing extreme.  We felt like this could be in part due to only taking 100mg more, but that it is also likely the case than even a larger dose would not have produced a profound increase in effects.  We all felt that it is probably just the nature of this substance that the initial rush is going to be the strongest, and that subsequent doses will be disappointing regardless of the size.\r\n\r\nBy about 9pm, we were all mostly back to baseline.  I felt a little residual stimulation, but not in the uncomfortable way I sometimes feel at the end of a coke, speed, or MDMA high.  Jillian and I went home at about 10pm.  We were definitely down by this time.  My eyes had been incredibly dilated during the peak of the experience, but were already starting to reduce in size a bit.  I was asleep by 11, and didn't have any trouble falling asleep.  The following day it was slightly more difficult than usual to get out of bed despite the fact that I went to bed at my usual time and felt that I had slept well.  I felt fine all day, but began to get a little more tired than usual in the afternoon.  I took a nap when I got home from work, which is not completely unheard of for me, but not really normal either.  I didn't feel depressed or 'cracked out' or anything of that sort, just a little more tired than usual.\r\n\r\nI understand why people compare this substance to MDMA as there are many similarities in effects, but it certainly isn't (for me and my friends at least) an MDMA replacement, and Jillian and I both feel that we prefer MDMA.  For one, the duration is in fact short.  In some instances (such as on a wednesday evening during the school year) this is a good thing, but this substances doesn't seem like it would be good for taking on a night out.  I enjoyed how it provided a very comfortable level of stimulation.  I felt energized and awake, but I never felt fidgety or uncomfortable, and I had no trouble falling asleep just five hours after the initial dose.  We were all definitely high, but we felt very clear headed at the same time.  This isn't a 'clear your calendar' kind of drug like MDMA or LSD.  I experienced some stomach discomfort, but Jillian and Laura did not.  It was a bit like that gross acidy feeling that I sometimes get if I drink a citrus soda on an empty stomach.  I began to notice some mild heartburn just as I was getting out of bed the next morning, but it subsided by the time I was dressed and such.  It returned in the late afternoon, but soon subsided again.  It however came back a bit worse after I had dinner and lasted for a couple hours until I broke down and took a couple tablespoons of apple cider vinegar (it works, but it's gross).  I cannot be certain the heartburn was from the mephedrone, but I rarely ever get heartburn and I don't recall ever having it repeatedly subside and then return for over 24 hours.\r\n\r\nJillian and I both agreed that although we see why people say mephedrone is moreish, we don't see why people are so compelled to redose that they consume dangerous amounts.  Before we started, we decided how much we were going to take, and although we had a desire to keep taking more than our agreed upon amount, it was not difficult to resist this temptation even though we had more available.  I really don't think that any amount of redosing will bring back the initial rush, which for about 10 minutes or so was intense enough that I may have mistaken it for MDMA.  We decided that next time we try it, we will go ahead and just take a full 250mg dose to begin with, enjoy those beautiful 10 minutes of MDMA-like bliss, and then just let it go.  There doesn't seem to be much benefit in controlled redosing, and it sounds like there is much detriment in compulsive redosing, so we decided that in the future we'll just take the whole amount in a single dose.  Laura does feel that she didn't experience the effects quite as strongly as Jillian and I, which may be in part due to her Prozac use.  In short, it was fun and I'm glad we did it and I'm glad we have more and will get to do it again, but it certainly doesn't have that same magic that makes MDMA so special.\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2010ExpID: 85039\nGender: Male \nAge at time of experience: 27 \nPublished: Apr 29, 2010Views: 31,780\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n",
