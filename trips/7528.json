This was not necessarily a bad trip, just an uncomfortable one.....\r\n\r\nWe started out at 4pm, ate the tabs and called for a cab to take us to the hills where we wouldn't be bothered by reality. Earlier that day we wrote down our address on a piece of paper and took it with us, in the event that we wanted to go home before we sober up, we could hand the paper to the cab driver, and he would handle the rest.  \r\n\r\nThe hills are about a 10 minute drive from the house.  As soon as we arrived, I was already feeling funny.  There was a porta potty nearby, so I went in.  My friends were talking outside and the sounds were noticebly strange.  We hiked for about 10 minutes, and I was feeling really tingly, and could not stop smiling!  Now it had been about a total of thirty minutes since we dropped.  I was amazed at the speed of the effects coming on.  Walking down the trail a little more now, things are buzzing, butterflies are cicling with magnificant trails following, like a million rays of light, all red and yellow.  There were two ladies walking their dogs that stopped to chat about 30 feet away from us.  This made me really uncomfortable.  I was beginning to feel the paranoia that I always do, but a little stronger this time.  At first I could make out what the two ladies were saying, but within a couple of minutes, it was all a bunch of mush.....just like Charlie Brown's mom.  \r\n\r\nWe moved to a different spot, as hard as it was for me to walk at this point.  My legs felt like rubber, and I could not stop laughing.  At this point the hallucinations were starting.  I thought there were 10 or so people walking around, all with dogs.  I asked my boyfriend if it was real, and he said no.  Laying on the grass for about another hour or so I think......15 seconds seems like an hour sometimes.  My boyfriend was running up and down the hill like he was a mad man, just full of energy saying 'Yahoo, isn't this fun??'  I could not move.  I wanted something, but I wasn't quite sure what it was.  I could just not get comfortable, so we moved again.  This time into a crater-like bowl shape on the side of a hill.  Getting really dark now, there were so many things to see in this 'crater'.  Trees moving, faces forming within the rocks and making faces at me, the grass breathing.  I suddenly felt like the crater was closing in on me.  I could no longer see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I got scared and wanted to go home.  Uneasy, and not wanting to spoil everyone else's time, I went with the flow.  \r\n\r\nNext we moved up to the top of the hill where we get an incredible view of the freeway and all of the lights.  It was cold, and scary out there.  I was at a place where I just wanted to stare at the lights with all of the energy shooting off in the sky.  The clouds forming animals and people dancing.  I could not focus my eyes on one single thing, they were jumping all over the place.  I think one of the reasons I didn't have a better time is because it was dark, and I could not tell if there was someone (from reality world) standing right in front of me or not.  I had to remind myself that I was not going to stay like this.  'It's just a drug'  I kept telling myself.  My wonderful man sitting there trying to comfort me but it just wouldn't work.  Suddenly a BRIGHT light goes on in the residential area below us.  My boyfriend yells 'Everybody Down!'  We lay there in complete silence.  I could hear all of our hearts beating LOUD.  I thought it was a cop and we weren't supposed to be there.  The most horrible things were going through my head.  I was afraid I would be forced to talk to him or something.  Then the light goes off.  \r\n\r\nI was still afraid to look.  Finally my man says 'It's ok, it was only somebody's motion sensor light in their yard.'  Holy smokes.  My pupils were so huge, that a mere porch ligh from 200 feet away seemed like a cop spotlight.    At this time I convinced everyone to go home.  I wanted a comfortable place that I was farmiliar with.  We ventured on down the hill throught these massive sticks sticking out of the ground as tall as we were all around us.  We obviously lost track of the trail, and could not find it.  I was practically running down the hill, frightened almost like someone was chasing me.  My boyfriend kept trying to hold me back and slow me down.  This only made me feel worse.  I was still peaking really good.  I could see the end of the trail that meets the main road.  It would look like it was 10 feet in front of my face.  I would take 30 more steps, and look up, and I was still as far away from the end as I was the last time I looked.  This went on for another 10 - 15 minutes, or so I thought before we were level.  \r\n\r\nWe were now walking through a swamp that was about 1 foot deep.  I felt like I was sinking in quick sand.  When we got out of the swampy area I reached down to feel my pants, only to find that they were completely dry!  Not even any mud.  :) Hehe.  Phew, almost home free, then CRAP!  We have reached a freakin' dead end.  A wire fence all the way areound us.  But this was never here before???  AAAAAHHHHH.....I think everyone was a little freaked out about this.  It was a very trapped feeling, almost clausterphobic.  I remember hearing screams from a child near by and parents yelling.  I started running.  We found the end of the fence, and called a cab.  How did my boyfriend call a cab???  How could he possibly even speak?  This made me think he was coming down, and I didn't like the feeling of having to finish my peak alone.  Waiting for the cab on the curb for what seemed like a whole night, listening to my boyfriend talk about normal real things like the economy, and buying a house someday.  I just could not comprehend this.  Here comes five pairs of headlights!  \r\n\r\nYeah, the cab is here.  We walked towards the van, waving it down.  When it stops, we realize it wasn't a cab, it was a mom with a carload of kids inside.  Boy, she must have thought we were loopy.  I am discouraged once again.  The next car that came was in fact the cab.  We got in and looked at the strange looking man about to take our lives into his hands.  He never said a word to us.  It was like he sensed our energy or something.  Going up and down hills felt like a roller coaster ride, hearing all of the creaks and cracks inside the car, with the radio on so low, but yet it was like we were at a concert.  Stop lights stayed red for an eternity, watching 500,000 cars in cross traffic going by.  It was hard to make out where we were even though I've lived here for 12 years.  \r\n\r\nStill peaking in the cab, as soon as we got home and walked inside it was like the world came back all within 10 seconds.  I was no longer peaking, but still feeling effects.  We put on the Doors, and it rocked us to sleep.\r\n\r\nNext time, I am going to do it all during the day time.  I can't fight it.  I really just have to go with it.  I am humble, and bow down to the acid gods.  Pretty powerful stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2001ExpID: 7528\nGender: Female \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: Mar 31, 2003Views: 101,488\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n"
