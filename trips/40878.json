I'm 35, and hadn't used any psychedelic substances in nearly 15 years, after being a frequent LSD and mushroom fanatic between the ages of 16 and 20.  I must have tripped 300 times on acid alone, but found I had come to the end of what it could 'teach' me and suddenly I found myself not desiring any psychedelics in my life.  Well, recently I have come to several crossroads in my life -- ending a job i've been in for 10 years, contemplating a relocation to a new city, ending a problematic opiate addiction, etc.  It seemed the perfect time to 'step back' and get some perspective, the kind that psychedelics can provide at their most useful (IMO).  \r\n\r\nT+0:  ingested 25mg 4-HO-mipt in a gelcap.  I hadn't eaten anything in 7+ hours, since I had heard that an empty stomach aids absorption.  Also, I had taken 15mg the night before, on a full stomach, and experienced only the lightest of psychedelic feelings -- mostly, it felt like being high on good pot, with a little visual disturbance thrown in for good measure.  So, I wanted to get a fuller experience - hence the higher dose and the empty stomach.  This turned out to be a good idea.\r\n\r\nSetting:  in my basement hideaway, where I keep my music, computer equipment, video games, photography equipment, books, etc.  My family (wife and three kids) is asleep upstairs (as I'm starting around 11:00 pm).  I feel safe here, alone but not lonely, with access to my favorite toys and music.\r\n\r\nT+20 minutes:  feeling of approaching effects, slight body high (no bodyload, just tingly feelings and energized feelings in my limbs).  \r\n\r\nT+40 minutes:  the experience has rapidly progressed to this point.  I feel a distinct sharpening of all senses.  Music is incredible, the sounds so vibrant, clear -- I hear details in very familiar songs that I never noticed before.  But, it's not just that the sounds are so vibrant and richly detailed, it's also that the emotional import of the music and lyrics are palpable, like the music is playing directly on elements of my emotional landscape. I'm listening to a 120 song random play (in itunes) that I made up for tonight.  I feel as though each song is like throwing an I Ching, really -- the way certain songs from my past, or certain stories they tell, reflect on different aspects of my life and present conditions.  The music is playing on my emotional landscape, as if each song was plucking a different string on my mental harp.  I am reminded of friends, issues in my life, goals -- and each song reflects a different aspect of my inner lanscapes, implants or reminds me of different thoughts.  I do not feel out of control at all, although the music affects me profoundly.  A particularly sad song ('if you know time' by robyn hitchcock -- a meditation on the decay of the body, despite the continued vitality of the spirit) has me close to weeping, so I skip it!\r\n\r\nT+1:15:  i've continued listening to music, feeling ecstatic, body feelings greatly enhanced.  It's an erotic-like experience, very sensual all over my body.  The visuals are obvious but not overwhelming.  Objects take on a 4-D feel, as if breathing or moving through time in a way that is visually apparent.  CEV not much to speak of, which surprises me given what i've read of others' experiences.  I feel a bit clammy and sweaty, but this feeling passes in 10 minutes or so.  By this time, the experience is definitely hitting peak, but it is not overwhelming.  I feel leveled out on a plateau, which ends up lasting about two hours.\r\n\r\nT+1:30:  I decide to go upstairs and take a warm bath, partly because of the body temperature disturbances noted above.  I light candles in the bathroom, as white light is intensely irritating to me.  The bath is wonderful, the hot water stimulating my body all over.  I consider waking my wife to see if she wants to have sex, but decide against it.  I can see, however, how sex would be an amazing experience, especially if she were dosed as well.  \r\n\r\nI spend my time (45 minutes or so) in the bath contemplating my life.  I feel a detachment from my problems that is very rewarding -- I am able to think about emotionally difficult topics (like losing my job & my present job search) without panic or worry.  I realize that I have more power than I recognize, that I am the 'author' of my life story.  Outside forces diminish in importance -- my choices are clearly paramount.  Looking back after the experience, the insight does not seem as profound as it did at the time, but I have retained the emotional sense of power over my future.  I find this to be very satisfying, essentially exactly what I was looking for going into the experience.\r\n\r\nT+3:30:  after my bath, I return to my music for an hour or so.  Although the emotional reaction to the music has diminished, the enveloping feeling of listening to music remains.  Listening on headphones provides a very full 3-D soundscape, eyes closed I feel the music surrounding me.  I spend an enjoyable time, but the peak has passed.  So, too, have my feelings of intense reflection -- now things feel more 'fun' and absurd.  I speak with a friend on the phone for 30 minutes, relating my experiences and insights.  She is the perfect person to talk to, and I feel very close to her (even if she is 2000 miles away at this point).  We laugh a lot, as I tell stories about things that have struck me as absurd and funny.\r\n\r\nT+4:00:  I go upstairs again and get out my DVD set of the Simpsons 5th season.  Shortly after, my 8 year old son wakes from a nightmare and comes and joins me lying on the couch.  By this point, I feel pretty grounded, although I am still experiencing the effects of the compound.  I feel very relaxed and connected with my kid, and we watch the simpsons together for 90 minutes, laughing a lot and lying together.  I would say this period was the most 'fun' of the whole experience, as I am able to connect with my son very well.  Even at 8 years old, he has developed typically male emotional barriers, which are down at this early point in the morning.  He cuddles with me on the couch in a way he hasn't since he was three.  It is great.\r\n\r\nT+6:00:  I'm feeling like the experience is pretty much complete.  I smoke some pot, which brings back a little of the visual element, but basically it just helps me feel sleepy.  I feel very hungry and eat a bowl of pasta - very satisfying, without any stomach disturbances at all.  I fall asleep by T+6:30.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I have NO after effects, other than feeling tired from sleep deprivation.  A very positive experience overall, very earthy/natural feeling, like psilocybin -- not chemically-feeling the way LSD can effect you.  I will definitely be trying this again.\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2005ExpID: 40878\nGender: Male \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: May 9, 2005Views: 22,497\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n",
