This is one that I won't soon\r\nforget. I hadn't had LSD in a pretty long time... about 15 months since my\r\nlast mild experience, and around 2 years since my last full blown LSD\r\nexperience, which had been a little on the rough side. I've been exploring\r\nother entheogens quite thoroughly in this time, but I stayed away from LSD\r\nfor a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\n        With my 10th rebirthday approaching, however, I decided it was\r\ntime for a reunion. I obtained a hit of green geltab acid, and set it\r\naside for the upcoming anniversary.\r\n\r\n        June 4th finally came, and I felt that old familiar nervous\r\nanticipation rising in me. Acid! My first and most familiar ally... I\r\nfound myself incredibly nervous, which struck me as silly. I've done this\r\ncountless times. I've done crazy shit like ayahuasca. Why is a little hit\r\nof acid causing so much tension? I guessed just because it had been so\r\nlong. I decided on 11PM for take-off.\r\n\r\n        Around 10:15, I decided to go on my regular internet chatroom to\r\nrelax and smoke some cannabis before take-off. I go on there and find one\r\nperson taking AMT, one person taking DPT, one person taking AMT with\r\nmushrooms, one taking DPT with ketamine, someone else taking LSD, and a\r\nfew other assorted trippers. Surprise, it looks like the universe decided\r\nto throw me a spontaneous rebirthday virtual-party! Well, alright then!\r\n\r\n        I placed the sacrament at the foot of my Buddha carving, and lit a\r\nstick of incense. I reflected upon all that I had been through with LSD\r\nover the last 10 years, and all the wonderful things I have learned from\r\nit. 11PM, down the hatch! Well, like I said 10 years ago, theres no\r\nturning back now!\r\n\r\n        I felt a strong alert by 11:15PM, and knew I was going to be in\r\nfor a wild ride. I was also overcome by a strong wave of nostalgia about\r\nLSD. I put on headphones and listened to Moody Blues, broke out a folder\r\nof my old LSD-influenced drawings, and began reminiscing. I read old LSD\r\nreports of mine (unfortunately, I've only made a few of them). I thought\r\nabout how different of a world it was when I first fell through the rabbit\r\nhole. There was still a Soviet Union. The Internet was still not much more\r\nbeyond the wet dreams of a few visionary geeks. Someone reminded me that\r\nthe Tiananmen Square massacre happened the same day. 10 years. Wow...\r\n\r\n        Around 12:15, I wasn't tripping unusually hard, I was at a Plus 2\r\non the Shulgin scale. I started to get worried that I wouldn't trip any\r\nharder. By 12:30-12:45, however, I realized that I was about to trip quite\r\na bit harder. I went to lay down just as I found myself hurled into an\r\namazing Plus 4. I remembered how much I loved LSD right then, and wondered\r\nwhy I had let it go so long.\r\n\r\n        The peak was spectacular. I was laying in bed in a dark room, the\r\nbest way to experience acid I think, and the closed-eye visuals were\r\nmindblowing. At the same time, I felt that high-speed LSD consciousness\r\ntrain blasting through my skull. The visuals and thoughts were very much\r\nin sync. I thought about many things... how much I had missed acid, how\r\nmuch I had learned from it over the years... and then into reflections on\r\nmy life. Realization that this was my first acid trip as a non-smoker,\r\nwhich struck me as being an important milestone. After a little while, I\r\nstopped thinking *about* anything and I became just a process of\r\nabstract thinking, accompanied by the fantastic acid visualscapes of the\r\ndisembodied eye state. I experienced strange temporal distortions, had\r\nvisions of the LSD 'spirit' appearing to me as a yound woman dressed in\r\nwhite muslin, saw both the dark and the light sides of acid as a sort of\r\n'This Is Your Life' nostalgia session. I had a particularly amusing vision\r\nof people putting tabs of acid to their tongues and immediately sprouting\r\nwings from their mouths and flying off to the 'real' world (a la 'The\r\nMatrix', sort of).\r\n\r\n        Sometime during the height of the peak, around 1-1:30AM I would\r\nestimate, I had a very strange experience. I had the sensation that I was\r\nsomehow communicating with an entity - which I soon realized was Becky.\r\nThis had a strange feeling of being real... some sort of telepathic link.\r\nI found myself talking to her soundlessly in some sort of impossible\r\nspace, and rapidly became confused as to which one of us was who. 'Whats\r\nhappening?' I felt her think... and I thought back 'I don't know, I just\r\nthink our realities are overlapping...we'll just have to ride it out.' I\r\nfelt a strong feeling of caring, and soon after, it was as if we zoomed\r\napart at hundreds of miles per hour and the contact was broken. The\r\nstrange thing is that the next morning when I spoke with her, she asked\r\n'So, did you feel us talking about you last night?'\r\n\r\n        Around 3-3:30AM, things leveled off enough that I was able to move\r\naround. I returned to the internet chatroom, and soon someone convinced me\r\nto try a little ketamine, saying that the combination was amazing. I cut\r\nsome out into two large lines, returned to my bedroom, snorted the\r\nketamine, and lay down. I waited. I got a strange visual effect where\r\neverything began to 'melt' somewhat - the effect is similar to what would\r\nhappen if you sprayed water on a watercolor painting. This only lasted a\r\nshort while. I felt a mild increase in the trip's 'weirdness' factor, but\r\noverall it seemed to make no real big difference to the character of the\r\ntrip - I think I was already too far out for it to have any effect. I\r\nwasn't very disappointed, not being very fond of ketamine to begin with. \r\n\r\n        I got back on the chatroom and had a great time talking about\r\ntripping with everyone for a while. Around 5AM, I decided to take a little\r\nbit of DPT to boost myself back up a little. It added a little vibrational\r\nsignature to the trip, and brought back some intensity, but didn't add a\r\nwhole lot to the trip, as I only did a small quantity (25mg at most).\r\n\r\n        2 or 3 hours later I got an email from some guy in Serbia who had\r\nemailed us a few times before. It was a picture of a peace sign overlaid\r\non a potleaf. I decided to go to CNN's web s ite and saw a headline saying\r\nthe war in Kosovo could be over by the end of the weekend. I made a\r\nlittle prayer for peace.\r\n\r\n        Around 7AM, I had dropped down to a level where I was mainly\r\nstimulated, more than tripping, and decided it was time to take a little\r\nGHB to make myself sleepy. No such luck! I ended up consuming enough GHB\r\nto tranquilize a herd of elephants over the next 6 hours, and barely\r\nnoticed any effect over the lingering LSD stimulation. I finally managed\r\nto fall into a fitful sleep around 1PM, sleeping until 6, when I woke up\r\nphysically drained but mentally full of energy.\r\n\r\n        This was one amazing trip, totally worthy of a 10-year anniversary\r\ncelebration! And it was a spectacular reunion with an old, trusted friend.\r\nI won't be letting it go that long again before I schedule another date\r\nwith my beloved Lady Sidney the Divine...\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 1999ExpID: 2385\nGender: Male \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: Aug 30, 2001Views: 49,935\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n"
