But never ever before in my whole life had i felt absolutely at ease and at home inside my own skin.  it was a revelation.  and it was the most astonishing vision of the whole trip.  \r\n\r\nat about 1am we walked out to buy a pack of cigarettes.  the bar on the corner was open so in we went.  in the time it took us to cross the threshold and walk 5 feet inside the entire place fell silent with everyone staring at us.  my husband looked at me, but i just went forward and asked the bartender for a pack of camels and we left.  we stood on the corner a moment wondering what that had been about when suddenly a patron of the place exited foot first.  he'd kicked the door open, swearing and tore off down the street.  the only thing we could ever come up with to explain this odd scenario is that the neighborhood we lived in was home to a lot of illegal aliens and perhaps this was their bar and we didn't belong.  \r\n\r\nbut the interesting part to me is that this would have freaked me out in my normal condition and tripping it stayed exactly what it was.  just a minor glitch.  it was okay that i didn't know what they were thinking.  it was okay that they assigned a meaning to us being there that was not accurate.  it was okay.  i was okay.\r\n\r\nat dawn it was waning.  i listened to the band do 'rockin' chair' and could hear all the layers.  i cried.  'it's my belief we've used up all our time; this hill's too steep to climb and the days that remain ain't worth a dime...'  broke my heart to come down.  but nobody stays.  \r\n\r\ni went to bed after that.  so sad... until the cartoon of two hilarious chickens started on the wall of the room.  just like a parting gift.  i laughed till i cried again  -- then fell asleep.\r\n\r\ni tripped a few times again after that.  not many.  every time it was a visit home to myself.  to me without all the unnecessary social baggage of anxiety, guilt, shame, competition, comparison and rigid conformity.  how well i lived without all that!\r\n\r\nthe other day one of my sons was listening to a terence mckenna tape.  mckenna said that his life happened years ago in the amazon and that, in a sense, the time since has been throw-away.  i feel that way a bit myself.  \r\n\r\nbut not really.  lsd taught me.  gave me a glimpse.  lsd showed me what was valuable and necessary and what was just baggage.  showed me what i was dealing with and in what direction to head.   i never got over that.  i hope i never do.\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 1970ExpID: 24362\nGender: Female \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: Jun 9, 2003Views: 91,842\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n"
