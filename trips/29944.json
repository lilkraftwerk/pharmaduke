It was typed 30 minutes after the peak. \r\n\r\nHey. Okay. My business, that stinks of profundity, is to describe the trip, integrate the trip, as soon after tripping as I can. Now's the time I dictate: I wonder: What was real, or what IS real? I don't want a narrative, I want a meta-chronological gestalt of the fucking trip! \r\n\r\nWell I can tell you - the flash I've been looking for - the transcendence, the boundary dissolution - I finally got there - the breakthrough. I'm confused as hell, and hardly know how to describe it - tagging any words to its shining essence feels hideously futile... but something compels me to try... \r\n\r\nthere was boundless joy, infinite joy - only a brief moment of terror - bafflement - beyond lingual bafflement - this was not elves, no fucking self-dribbling basketballs, I can tell you that - a broad bonk on the head with a blunt cerebral/celestial filter - a cleansing - for a brief moment, I was cleansed of self - my self washed away, it really happened - it was not just a theory, it was a reality - \r\n\r\nthe ontology alteration, the shattering of the world is fully gone, but psychological aftershocks are still buffeting me as I write this, jostling, stunned - christ... \r\n\r\ndo i describe this experience using words like good and bad? do I impose values on it? Somehow, that doesn't seem right - abstract as possible, concrete as possible - I keep wanting to contradict, to do opposing things at once - somehow this relates to a philosophical theme of the trip, an intuitive insistence I had not planned for, nor had any anticipation of... \r\n\r\nwhen the real thing hits you - it's hard to know what to think \r\nyou should probably just shut up and look around - the world - look around your head \r\nbut you can't can you you babbling fool? - you wanna WRITE about it - in second person now - \r\nokay, go ahead then... maybe you'll wise up next tryp \r\ncause we ARE gonna do this again, my precious... \r\nsoon... at a higher dose - because as amazing as THIS experience was \r\n\r\nI know there are levels above this, and that is staggering \r\nI know if I do a bit more, with an open mind this time \r\nI know I can get even farther out - maybe transcendent of this strange transcendence... \r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, now I'll try a conventional narrative trip report: \r\n\r\nMy third experience resulted in about the same effects as the second, even though I thought I added more powder. This time I was very liberal with the powder (estimated 10-15mg). I was determined to get to the next level this time. Well I did. \r\n\r\nI sat down and took one big long toke, 15 seconds of inhalation. I started feeling it very early on, very strong, and very definitely this time. I took another big long toke, 15 seconds. About halfway through this toke, I knew it was escalating toward some novel perturbation of consciousness - something I hadn't experienced yet - I was in for a ride... \r\n\r\nI may have taken a third toke, I may have not - I don't remember - somewhere during this second toke, I phased out of the regular universe I was accustomed to, and emerged in something else - I felt pulled into some swirling foreign reality - panic immediately gripped me, but I struggled to remain calm - my whole field of vision seemed to distort - AS a field - as if what I saw was a flat texture being pulled off of some larger underlying essence - this was me stepping out of my 4 dimensional matrix of space time and encountering something greater - I could not handle the vertigo - I had to do SOMETHING - move!!! \r\n\r\nI got up off the chair and fell onto the couch. This leads me to believe that I wasn't as high as I could've been - that being, tranced and incapacitated, abandoned to the void... \r\n\r\nI lay there, overwhelmed, fearing my mind had been taken too far, too far to ever return to sanity - this was far beyond any psychedelic state I'd yet encountered - this was completely new. For a few seconds, I wanted nothing greater than to return to my previous state of consciousness. \r\n\r\nI felt the panic of the lucid dreamer trapped in a nightmare - anything could happen - I felt the terror of an impending obliteration...of what, I was not sure - but I knew it was too big for ME - and I was right - the universe was not big enough for ME and IT both... It was ME that was destroyed - ego lost. \r\n\r\nI was not feeling a void, rather a transmutation of reality - I felt my self, my ego, slip away rapidly, and completely, leaving a bizarre vacuum in the psyche that was now just a component of the universe - everything just a component - the loss of self brought me a feeling of unity and complete oneness with everything - infinity manifested as the doubt-destroying, blinding essence of existence - the self and my life were not real - life is but a dream - I'd been awakened, shaken out of the hypnosis of that narrow limited reality. \r\n\r\nI felt ecstatic that I had reached this state - I felt triumph - I felt enlightened - I felt every question was answered - I felt immortal - but I couldn't say why ~ \r\n\r\nProfound profane hilarity - cackles, giggles  \r\n\r\nI was on a profound positive plateau, stretched as a pretzel figure-8 paradox strange loop - I felt like I'd finally inhabited certain mystic states - I felt neither cosmic consciousness nor solipsistic consciousness - the feeling was on another spectrum entirely - words I carried were INFINITY and OTHER - I went to my bedroom, through a bubbling twisting warping hallway, got on my computer, and typed typed typed... For a second I was ready to anoint EVERYONE ENLIGHTENED DIVINITY! \r\n\r\nI typed my ecstasy, which startled to dissolve into skepticism, with revelations fleeing, fleeting like nitrous oxide truths - William James' axiom rang in my head: 'Everything in this universe is the smell of burnt almonds.' Might as well have been. Is. Was. \r\n\r\nI was far MORE than myself, and far less as well. I felt filtered into a meta-self, shaken from self, loose, drifting, free... \r\n\r\nbut with nagging skepticism \r\nwas it all real? \r\nwhat does it mean? \r\nshould I care what it means? \r\nwhy am I asking this? \r\n\r\nthe jolt from this otherworld back to reality was jarring - hard - mundanities sweeping in - window closing... \r\n\r\nwhat do I make of it? what do I make of it? \r\nPressure to make something of it - strain - \r\n\r\nknowledge that i'll forget what it was like \r\nI'll HAVE to forget, right? How can I retain it? No way that's possible. \r\nI'll forget, and what's worse, I won't BELIEVE! \r\nI'll believe I was hyperbolizing, souping up the description... \r\n\r\nwell...I dunno. \r\nThat was then and this is now. \r\n\r\nAnd time keeps on slipping - slipping away \r\nwhat was once a dilated near-infinite moment \r\nis now an afternoon going by much too quickly - a trip fading... \r\n\r\nAllowing myself to indulge in the banality of spell-check is the final sign that Im down for good. \r\n\r\nLol. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy did I type? \r\nI shouldn't have tried to english it so soon \r\nI should have experienced, not recorded. \r\n\r\nThis is all lies though - language... \r\n\r\n~ \r\n\r\nEgo loss, for 'me' (whatever that is) is something that I 'myself' can't really make sense of after the phenomenon is over. I only remember it as a pale fact, not a reality. If my experience on three grams of shrooms was a 5 or 6 (on DMTurner's scale), the 5meoDMT flash was probably a 7 or 8. Certainly a jolt - an unambiguous blast into new territory. And still... I must go further. \r\n\r\nI'd rather use nnDMT than 5meoDMT, as the former is allegedly much more visual - I assume the hallucinations could better help me assign meaning to the experience - but 5meo is what I have to work with, and it's definitely powerful stuff in its own right.\n\n\n\n\n\nExp Year: 2004ExpID: 29944\nGender: Male \nAge at time of experience: Not Given \nPublished: Jan 15, 2004Views: 39,536\n[ View as PDF (for printing) ] [ View as LaTeX (for geeks) ]\n[ Switch Colors ]\n\n\n\n\n"
